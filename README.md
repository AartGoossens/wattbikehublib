# wattbikehublib
Python library that provides access to Wattbike sessions and other data stored in the Wattbike Hub.

## Features
- List activities
- Get data from single sessions
- Get training zones
- Get current zone record
- Get historical zone records
- Get username from Wattbike Hub homepage

## How does it work?
The Wattbike Hub does not offer a public API. Well... to be more accurate: the API is not documented. There are a few API endpoints that are used by both the website and apps that offer some API functionality. I used these endpoints to build this library.

## Requirements
- Python 3 (Parts of the code might work in Python 2. Full support for Python 2 is not planned)
- All the libraries in requirements.txt installed (in your virtualenv).
- Wattbike Hub account set to 'publicly viewable'. Check this in your [Wattbike Hub settings](http://hub.wattbike.com/account/edit)
